# 1.0.0-dev

- `camo-rs` now refuses to start if no content-types are allowed. Before that, Camo would start up just fine, but reject everything, which can be confusing.

# 0.1.0

This is the first public release. While it is not considered "production-ready" yet, it should work, and is currently being tested in experimental rollouts.
